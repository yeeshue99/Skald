> Leverage mex: this project is managed with the mex scaffold under `.mex/`. At the
> start of every session, read `.mex/ROUTER.md` (and this anchor) before any task,
> follow ROUTER's CONTEXT -> BUILD -> VERIFY -> DEBUG -> GROW contract, load the
> routed `.mex/context/` and `.mex/patterns/` files for the task, and after
> meaningful work run the GROW step (update the scaffold, `mex log` the rationale).
> Run `mex check` to catch drift between the scaffold and the code.

# [Project Name]

## What This Is
<!-- One sentence. What does this project do?
     Length: 1 sentence maximum.
     Not a tagline — a factual description of what the software does.
     Example: "A REST API for managing inventory across multiple warehouse locations." -->

## Non-Negotiables
<!-- Hard rules the agent must never violate. Not preferences — rules.
     These are the things that, if broken, cause real damage to the codebase.
     Length: 3-7 items maximum. More than 7 means the list has not been prioritised.
     Example:
     - Never write database queries outside of the repository layer
     - Never commit secrets or API keys
     - Always handle errors explicitly — no silent failures -->

## Commands
<!-- The exact commands needed to work on this project.
     Include: run dev server, run tests, run linter, build.
     Use the actual commands from this codebase — not placeholders.
     Example:
     - Dev: `npm run dev`
     - Test: `npm test`
     - Lint: `npm run lint`
     - Build: `npm run build` -->

## After Every Task
After meaningful work, run GROW:
- Ground: what changed in reality?
- Record: update `.mex/ROUTER.md` and relevant `.mex/context/` files
- Orient: create or update a `.mex/patterns/` runbook if this can recur
- Write: bump `last_updated` on changed scaffold files and run `mex log` when rationale matters

## Navigation
At the start of every session, read `.mex/ROUTER.md` before doing anything else.
For full project context, patterns, and task guidance — everything is there.
